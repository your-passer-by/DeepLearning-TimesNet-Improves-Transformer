# Transformer Improved Through the Concept of TimesNet  

## Introduction  
This project is a group deep learning course project.  

## Overview  
This project implements a Transformer model improved based on the concepts of TimesNet. By integrating the time-series modeling capabilities of TimesNet, the model enhances the Transformer’s performance in handling time-series data and tasks involving temporal dependencies.
